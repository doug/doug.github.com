<p><strong>Programmer</strong>, <strong>hacker</strong>, <strong>designer</strong>, <strong>scientist</strong>, and <strong>artist</strong> driven by an interest in the negative space of everything. That negative space is interaction between all things, I enjoy the process of analyzing, simulating, exploring, and understanding the subtle inter-dependent lives that space produces. Am currently pursuing a Masters in Media Arts and Sciences at MIT under Professor Pattie Maes in the Fluid Interfaces Group. Received a dual degree, a BS in Computer Science and a BFA in Fine Art, from Carnegie Mellon University. Before MIT, I interned with the wonderful people at in Martin Wattenberg&#8217;s group at IBM research, and worked full time at the Yahoo! Design Innovation Team in San Francisco. Greatest love is when a project takes something immense and difficult to comprehend and makes it simple and familiar; as well as conversely when it takes the simple and familiar and makes you realize you can never really understand it in full.</p>
