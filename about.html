<p>As of right now I'll self define as a <strong>programmer</strong>, <strong>hacker</strong>, <strong>designer</strong>, <strong>scientist</strong>, and <strong>artist</strong>. One who's life seems to be governed by three very simple elements; <em>the longing for love</em>, <em>the quest for knowledge</em>, and <em>empathy for the failure of the world</em>. I feel this is something true for almost everyone I admire. Love brings joy, denying our search for it as a driving force would be absurd. It fights the loneliness of existence and those moments make all the rest worth struggling for. The search for knowledge, to me has always been encapsulated in the essence of a six year old with the power of recursion, able to ask why recursively ad infinitum, and I find that absolutely beautiful. Love and knowledge are the pursuit of the platonic solids, but it is empathy that makes me an engineer and an artist, desiring to work with my hands in the constantly changing ground of earth, and see change. The desire to understand the world is love, the power to change it is knowledge, and empathy is the spark that drives them to action.</p>

<p>In that vein, what do I see in the world that is changeable and whose change would be beneficial. While that list is innumerable, one issue most noticeable is in the flow of information and our understanding of it between the digital and physical world. As such, I wish to augment human intelligence by working to solve when and how to bridge the deluge of digital data into the physical world. To identify, extract, and present that small element of digital information to add true and novel benefit to our lives rather than overloading or burdening our actions. How would one start to query every item in the world, and if we could how would each object and each moment reveal themselves to us differently?</p>
<p>I am currently pursuing a <a href="http://media.mit.edu/">Masters in Media Arts and Sciences at MIT</a> under Professor <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~pattie/">Pattie Maes</a> in the <a href="http://fluid.media.mit.edu/">Fluid Interfaces Group</a>. I received a dual degree, a BS in Computer Science and a BFA in Fine Art, from <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a> working primarily with <a href="http://www.flong.com/">Golan Levin</a>. Before MIT, I interned with the wonderful people at in <a href="http://www.bewitched.com/">Martin Wattenberg&#8217;s</a> group at <a href="http://domino.watson.ibm.com/cambridge/research.nsf/pages/cue.html">IBM research</a>, and worked full time at the <a href="http://research.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Design Innovation Team</a> in San Francisco. My greatest love is when a project takes something immense and difficult to comprehend and makes it simple and familiar; as well as conversely when it takes the simple and familiar and makes you realize you can never really understand it in full. In other words, I tend to enjoy simplifying the complex and complexifing the simple, because in reality its all somewhere in the middle.</p>
