title: About

**Programmer**, **hacker**, **designer**, **scientist**, and **artist** driven by an interest in the negative space of everything. That negative space is interaction between all things, I enjoy the process of analyzing, simulating, exploring, and understanding the subtle inter-dependent lives that space produces. Am currently pursuing a Masters in Media Arts and Sciences at MIT under Professor Pattie Maes in the Fluid Interfaces Group. Received a dual degree, a BS in Computer Science and a BFA in Fine Art, from Carnegie Mellon University. Before MIT, worked full time at the Yahoo! Design Innovation Team in San Francisco. Greatest love is when a project takes something immense and difficult to comprehend and makes it simple and familiar; as well as conversely when it takes the simple and familiar and makes you realize you can never really understand it in full.

Anyway if you feel like emailing me you can do so at *doug at dougfritz*.
