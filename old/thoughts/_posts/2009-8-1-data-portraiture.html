title: Data Portraiture
author: Doug Fritz & Aaron Zinman
description: 'The art world uses the tradition of portraiture to semantically compress relevant information about their subjects into a single art work. We believe this tradition can be extended into the digital realm by the use of topic modeling to compress individualsâ€™ information into generative data portraits. Data portraiture has strong implications for navigating large social spaces, collaborative systems, and self reflection. We briefly showcase our works thus far to highlight potential directions in this emerging field.'
