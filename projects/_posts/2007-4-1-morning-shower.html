description: 'Photograph of each individual water droplet I used during my morning shower, taken with a high-speed camera. Every drop of water was photographed, cropped, and individually printed (Roughly 1,682,425 droplets photographed). Final print is 3 feet by 50 feet! You obviously see only a small subset of the droplets in the cropped photo above.'
