description: 'In this project lifestream information (bookmarks and emails) are aggregated and used to generate user interests, which in turn are combined to generate ambient maps of connectivity projected on the ceiling of a social space. The idea was to act as a compass for social navigation, giving subtle hints of related topics and connectivity of interests between people in the room.'
