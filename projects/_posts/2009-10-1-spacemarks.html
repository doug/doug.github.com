SpaceMarks is a tool for spatially organizing bookmarks and emails. It incorporates a consistent zoomable space for organizing your personal information. One can intuitively group and cluster and move items, and then also bind meta data or tags to the spatially organized objects. The backend uses reinforcement learning to create a model of why objects are placed where they are in space. What is interesting here is then comparing my externalized mental map to someone elseâ€™s.
