	<b>Abstract</b><br />
	In this paper we describe a method to wirelessly communicate between two or more consumer video cameras by blinking the camera flash in a temporally encoded signal. The signal can be decoded by analyzing the video frames over time. In addition, the spatial relationship between flash and camera can be derived by the flash’s position within the camera’s field of view, which, in combination with other technologies, can help to create immersive, participatory vision-based interactive environments.<br />

	Because sender and receiver are in two different devices they cannot be synced. To solve this we developed a cyclical code that does not require a start signal, and the individual signals had to last longer than one video frame
