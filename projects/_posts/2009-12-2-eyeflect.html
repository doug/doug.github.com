teaser: '/projects/eyeflect/eyeflect_t.png'
description: 'Controlling the high speed flashing and reading of multiple infrared LED/phototransistors pairs we create a structure for lightweight camera-less gaze estimation in a mobile form factor. We show that it is possible to do gaze estimation of the human eye using only four leds and phototransistors, by a trick in the sequence and processing of flashing. Thus enabling cheap, and effective gaze estimation for a variety of HCI applications.'

		Proposed setup: Three LEDs are positioned in front of the eye at the right angle to shine into it. By measuring very close to the light source it should be possible to capture the retroflection.
