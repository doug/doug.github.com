{{page.description}}

    While fluttering back and forth, back and forth,  
    between the transom of our minds,  
    do we not each seek and long   
    for something on the other side?  

    As we pass our states through  
    doorways and in arches,  
    we engage a rhythm of banter  
    with each place along our route.  

    Humbled as we pass into the echoing of a church.  
    Forlorn as we stride through allies bathed in the countenance of shadow.  
    And still we cannot help but crack a smile  
    in the doorway of a friend who means much more.  

    But is it the place, that door, a moment?  

    What root may we uncover in the wavelike variance of passage?  

    ...  

    In the between of our self-encircled rooms we see transition,  
    newly aware of each moments strong distinctions.  

    However,  


    When knowingly we step through a passage that takes us nowhere,  
    born is our knowledge of transition's act in full.  

    That our inward breath and outward exhalation  
    is the movement of forces between two spaces never separated.
